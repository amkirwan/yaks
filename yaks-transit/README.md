# Yaks Transit

Map the Yaks data model directly to Transit.

Transit is a bit different than other formats like HAL,
Collection+JSON in that it's intended as a general serialization
format, not as a hypermedia format. It does however have a standard
extension to support links, based on the Collection+JSON links.
